            <h4 class="name TARTUFFE">DAMIS</h4> <p class="direction">(coming out of the closet in which he was hiding).</p>  
            <p class="speech">No, madam, no.  All this must be exposed.
            By hiding here I've heard all he proposed,
            And God in His goodness has guided me
            To confound this noisome bastard's treachery,
            To discover a way to take my vengeance
            For his hypocrisy and insolence,
            To wake up my father, and to justly screw
            This scumbag who wants to make love to you.</p>
            <h4 class="name DORINE">ELMIRE.</h4>  <p class="speech">No, Damis.  It's enough if he has striven
            To reform and merit the pardon I've given.
            Don't make me retract what I have avowed.
            I don't choose to discuss scandal out loud:
            A woman laughs at these masculine foibles,
            And never plagues her mate with paltry troubles.</p>
            <h4 class="name TARTUFFE">DAMIS.</h4> <p class="speech"> You have your own reasons for acting so,
            And I have reasons for my quid-pro-quo.
            The very thought of sparing him is a joke,
            And the insolent pride of this base bloke
            Has triumphed too often over my just wrath,
            And has sown too much trouble along my path.
            For too long that liar has ruled my old man
            Blocking both my love and that of Mariane.
            His perfidy must be brought to light of day,
            And for that God gives us a ready way.
            For this occasion I thank the good Lord;
            It is far too lucky to be ignored.
            The only way to deserve to lose it
            Is to have it in hand and not to use it.</p>
            <h4 class="name DORINE">ELMIRE.</h4> <p class="speech"> But Damis . . .</p>
            <h4 class="name TARTUFFE">DAMIS.</h4>    <p class="speech">             No, please, my mind is made up.
            It is time to rejoice and fill up the cup,
            And you're trying in vain to obligate me
            To give up the pleasure of my victory.
            I'm going to expose this affair without delay;
            This is just the thing that will make my day.</p>
