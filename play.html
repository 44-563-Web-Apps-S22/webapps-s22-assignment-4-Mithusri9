        <h2>Tartuffe</h2>
        <h3>Tartuffe, Laurent, Dorine</h3>
         <p>

            Tartuffe [observing Dorine].  Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
                    And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                    If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                    To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.<br>
            Dorine [aside].  Such affectation and boastful behavior!<br>
            Tartuffe.  What do you wish?<br>
            Dorine.                             To say . . .<br>
            Tartuffe [taking a handkerchief from his pocket].  Wait!  By our Savior,
                    Please!  Before you speak take this handkerchief.<br>
            Dorine.  Why?<br>
            Tartuffe.     Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                    Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                    And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.<br>
            Dorine.  Then you are quite ready for temptation,
                    And bare skin makes on you a big impression.
                    I truly don't know why you feel such passion;
                    I myself think lust is out of fashion,
                    For I could see you nude from top to toe
                    Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.<br>
            Tartuffe.  Put a little modesty in your discourse
                    Or I must leave you instantly perforce.<br>
            Dorine.  No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,
                    And I will just say this before I cease:
                    Madam is coming down to visit you
                    And demands the favor of a rendezvous.<br>
            Tartuffe.  Oh yes!  Most willingly!<br>
            Dorine [to herself].                Isn't he sweet!
                    I'm even surer now that dog's in heat.<br>
            Tartuffe.  Will she soon come?<br>
            Dorine.                         I think I can hear her.
                    Yes, there.  Now I will leave you two together.</p>
