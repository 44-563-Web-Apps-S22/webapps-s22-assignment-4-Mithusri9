                 SCENE II.-TARTUFFE, LAURENT, DORINE.
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>

            
                    (_observing_DORINE).<br>  Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
                    And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                    If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                    To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4> (aside).<br>  Such affectation and boastful behavior!<br>
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>What do you wish?<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4>                             To say . . .<br>
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>(taking a handkerchief from his pocket).<br>  Wait!  By our Savior,
                    Please!  Before you speak take this handkerchief.<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4> Why?<br>
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>  Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                    Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                    And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4>  Then you are quite ready for temptation,
                    And bare skin makes on you a big impression.
                    I truly don't know why you feel such passion;
                    I myself think lust is out of fashion,
                    For I could see you nude from top to toe
                    Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.<br>
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>  Put a little modesty in your discourse
                    Or I must leave you instantly perforce.<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4>  No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,
                    And I will just say this before I cease:
                    Madam is coming down to visit you
                    And demands the favor of a rendezvous.<br>
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>  Oh yes!  Most willingly!<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4> (to herself).<br>                Isn't he sweet!
                    I'm even surer now that dog's in heat.<br>
                <h4>TARTUFFE.</h4>  Will she soon come?<br>
                <h4>DORINE.</h4>                         I think I can hear her.
                    Yes, there.  Now I will leave you two together.</p>
